        <h2>Preservation</h2>

        <p>
          Frank Lloyd Wright designed Fallingwater for the Kaufmann family as a
          living structure - one so interposed with nature that the outside
          literally becomes part of the inside. Edgar Kaufmann, jr. once wrote:
          “In Fallingwater Wright captured the perfect essence of our desire to
          live with nature, to dwell in a forested place and be at home in the
          natural world.” However, the effects of time and weather on the
          materials that meld the house to its landscape have caused major
          building systems to reach the end of their useful lives. To address
          these preservation needs and uphold our commitment to protect
          Fallingwater as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Western Pennsylvania
          Conservancy is preparing for a major preservation initiative. The
          first phase of this multi-year effort will enable us to undertake the
          preservation of Fallingwater's major building systems, which total $3
          million. We expect work to begin in 2022.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          1935 Edgar jr. leaves the Taliesin Fellowship and returns to
          Pittsburgh. Edgar jr. becomes Merchandise Manager for Home Furnishings
          at Kaufmann's Department Store in Pittsburgh. He continues in this
          capacity until 1940. Edgar Kaufmann commissions Frank Lloyd Wright to
          design a weekend house for his family near Bear Run. Exhibition on
          11th floor of Kaufmann's Department Store, "New Homes for Old,"
          sponsored by the Federal Housing Administration featured model for
          Broadacre City. Department of Architecture is changed to Department of
          Architecture and Industrial Art, Philip L. Goodwin named chairman
          (1935-1940).
          <br /><br />
          1936 First working drawings of Fallingwater completed (January).
          Construction of Fallingwater begins (April); foundations completed
          (July); living room cantilever ready to pour (August).
          <br /><br />1937 Construction begins on Wright's design for Edgar
          Kaufmann's corner office on the tenth floor of Kaufmann's Department
          Store. A one-room interior executed primarily of cypress wood, the
          office included louvered windows and built-in storage cabinets
          designed on a two-foot-square module. The focal point was an abstract
          mural formed of six layers of cypress in a geometric design, based on
          60- and 120-degree shapes. Taliesin apprentice Manuel Sandoval
          constructed the mural and installed the office. John McAndrew, Curator
          of Architecture and Industrial Art at MoMA, writes asking to see
          Fallingwater. Architectural Forum offers to publish Wright's new work;
          Bill Hedrich photographs Fallingwater (November). Fallingwater's
          construction is completed. The Kaufmanns move in (December).
          <br /><br />1938 "A New House by Frank Lloyd Wright" exhibition is
          installed in the Time-Life Building (14 East 49th Street in New York),
          the temporary location of the Museum of Modern Art (January 25 to
          March 6). Curated by John McAndrew, Curator of Architecture and
          Industrial Art. Exhibition traveled for two years as part of the
          Museum's Department of Circulating Exhibitions. Edgar jr. begins work
          at MoMA part-time (until 1940). Fallingwater featured in Architectural
          Forum (January), Time (January 17) and Life (January 17), as well as
          hundreds of newspapers and periodicals worldwide. <br /><br />1939
          Fallingwater guest house is completed. Albert Einstein returns to
          western Pennsylvania for a conference with Jewish leaders on how to
          help protect Jews still trapped in Germany. Given the somber nature of
          the visit, there were no press conferences or public lectures on that
          trip. Already in the Pittsburgh area, the Kaufmann family invited him
          to Fallingwater. <br /><br />1940 "Frank Lloyd Wright: American
          Architect" exhibition opens at MoMA. Edgar jr. ends work at
          Kaufmann's; begins working full-time at MoMA (until 1955, less
          1942-1945 for war service). Kaufmanns sell La Torelle and take an
          apartment in the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh.
